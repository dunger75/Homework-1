Create another (separate) C++ program file with a  main  function.
In  main, in alphabtic order (the same order as listed above), create a  Planet  object for each of the planets and minor planets in the Solar System.
as each is created, insert it into the vector in ascending order based on the distance from the Sun  (use the  insert  function on the vector with an iterator).
consider writing a function which takes a  Planet  object and inserts it into the vector in the appropriate spot in the vector.
Once the vector is filled, print a report showing each planet.
Add a heading at the top of each column.
Do not use  pop_back.  Instead, simply use a loop to access and print the values of each planet in the vector, starting with element at position 0.
Inside the loop, use the  cout  object with I/O manipulators or use the  printf  function to align columns:
The name of the planet should be left-aligned (padded to the right)
The diameter and distance should be right-aligned (padded to the left).  Commas are not required, but are a nice touch.
The first part of your report might look like the following:

Solar System Planets by Distance
  
   Planet     Diameter  Dist. to Sun  
  ----------  --------  ------------
  Mercury         4878      57900000
  Venus          12104     108200000
  Earth          12756     149600000
  Mars            6787     227900000
  Ceres            952     413700000
               . . . . . . . .

After all planets have been printed, calculate and print totals for the diameter and distance columns.
Align and print the totals with their respective columns.
